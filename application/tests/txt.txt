Running the Unit Tests
Now we are ready to run the tests.

Execute the test and include a coverage report by running:

python3 -m pytest --cov
This will gather coverage of our app, our test code and any code in the venv,
which will skew our coverage result.

We can test the coverage of just the app.py file by running:

python3 -m pytest --cov=app
You should see that the tests currently only achieve 87% coverage.

We can see which lines of code we haven't been able to test by running:

python3 -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report term-missing
Can you figure out why those lines aren't being covered by the test?

We can also save the coverage report to an HTML file by running the following

python3 -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report html
This will create a directory called htmlcov. There are many files in there but the
one we are interested in is index.html. Open that in a web browser to access the coverage report.
